### How Information About You Is Shared
When you use the Services, certain information may be shared with other users and the public. For example:

* When you submit content (such as a post or comment or public chat) to the Services, any visitors to and users of our Services will be able to see that content, the username associated with the content, and time you originally submitted the content. Hiddout post is using short time URL for public visiting, which means any post's link you copy from Hiddout will only last a few hours before expired, after that time there is on way to see the post via link unless you directly go to Hiddout website to found the post again;

Otherwise, we do not share, sell, or give away your personal information to third parties unless one of the following circumstances applies:
* With our partners.  We may share information with vendors, consultants, and other service providers (but not with advertisers and ad partners) who need access to such information to carry out work for us. The partner’s use of personal data will be subject to appropriate confidentiality and security measures;

* To comply with the law.  We may share information in response to a request for information if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or required by, any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, including, but not limited to, meeting national security or law enforcement requirements. To the extent the law allows it, we will attempt to provide you with prior notice before disclosing your information in response to such a request;

* In an emergency.  We may share information if we believe it's necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person;

* To enforce our policies and rights;

* With your consent.  We may share information about you with your consent or at your direction;

* Aggregated or de-identified information.  We may share information about you that has been aggregated or anonymized such that it cannot reasonably be used to identify you. For example, we may show the total number of times a post has been upvoted without identifying who the visitors were.

### Ads
Hiddout currently does not have third-party advertisers, ad networks, and analytics providers to deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests and **will never do that without your approval**. 

### Analytics Partners
We use analytics partners (such as Cloudflare) to help analyze usage and traffic for our Services. As an example, we may use analytics partners to analyze and measure, in the aggregate, the number of unique visitors to our Services.

### Do Not Track
Most modern web browsers give you the option to send a Do Not Track signal to the websites you visit, indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. However, there is no accepted standard for how a website should respond to this signal, and we do not take any action in response to this signal. Instead, Hiddout suggests all users do not submit any information that could reasonably be used to identify you.

Also try using browser like **Brave**, **Tor** instead of **Chrome** for better privacy protection.
